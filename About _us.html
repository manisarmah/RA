                        Srinivasa Ramanujan was a great Indian mathematician and autodidact who with almost no formal training in pure mathematics, made extraordinary contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series and continued fractions. He was born in 22nd December, 1887 in Tamilnadu and died in 26th April 1920 at the age of 33 only. As a mark of respect to this great son of India, Ramanujan Academy is started after his name to establish a new revolution of science education in this part of the state
                       Considering the long felt need of a Science Academy imparting quality education along with the purpose of inculcating the basic human values among the young generation Ramanujan Academy is established.
